Bash scripts are used in this project for intialising PSQL container using Docker,and monitoring the hardware specifications and system performance data. This project also uses crontab to collect and generate real-time data and provide statistics for resource utilisation.Finally, the monitoring agent sends data to a database for storage and further analysis.",

        "JDBC App: The JDBC application developed primarily in Java deals with an RDBMS database and data manipulation is done using OOP concept such as Data Access Objects (DAO), Data Transfer Objects(DTO), and various other interfaces that joins both the java programming side and the relational database. At the core of this application, are the abilities to perform create, read, update, and delete operations from a RDBMS in a dockerized container of a PSQL instance. Apart from Java implementations in the project, MAVEN, Docker, PostgresSQL, and CLI are all interconnected to produce this application. The heart of the project lies in the concept of JDBC API which allows Java programs to access database management systems , and perform operations from a Java program interface.",
        "Grep App: The grep application in Java simulates the grep command used in Linux Bash  to search for a particular regex pattern from an input file. As a result, the program goes through serveral checks in main program to search for a pattern and once the pattern is found , it returns the ouput in the form of .txt file. This application is tested for an example file stored in root directory. The very famous Romeo Juliet pattern was used an input pattern in the Shaksphere file and output returns the pattern in the lines and store the results in an output .txt file. This project is build using MAVEN and deployment is done using Docker container."

During my course of studies, I published a couple of conference papers in IEEE focusing on implementation and use cases in the healthcare industry alonside working on my thesis. The thesis focuses on reducing the average time spent in queue by patients.The work of research instigated the mentality of effectively understanding the problem to debug it in correct way possible.Currently, I am working with Jarvis to gain and expand my skills by working on various projects in different programming languages such as Linux, SQL, Java, and Python in an agile environment."
