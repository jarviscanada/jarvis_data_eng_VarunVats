    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    description: Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent(LCMA) is used to monitor and collect data of various host machines which are connected through a network. The data consists of hardware specifications and CPU performance is stored in the form of a cluster. This clustered data is stored in Postgres SQL database using Docker containers. Further, the bash scripts are used to monitor this data and crontab is used to collect real-time data and generate statistics accordingly. In this project, monitoring agent is used to transfer the data to the database for further analysis.
