  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    description: Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent(LCMA) is used to monitor and collect data of various host machines which are connected through a network. The data consists of hardware specifications and CPU performance is stored in the form of a cluster. This clustered data is stored in Postgres SQL database using Docker containers. Further, the bash scripts are used to monitor this data and crontab is used to collect real-time data and generate statistics accordingly. In this project, monitoring agent is used to transfer the data to the database for further analysis.

    description:
      - "Grep App: The grep application in Java simulates the grep command used in Linux Bash  to search for a particular regex pattern from an input file . This application takes into consideration 3 important paramaters such as 
       1. The regex pattern user wants to search
       2. The root directory in which file is stored 
       3. The output file name and location
       As a result, the program goes through serveral checks in main program to search for a pattern and once the pattern is found , it returns the ouput in the form of .txt file. This application is tested for an example file stored in root directory. The very famous Romeo Juliet pattern was used an input pattern in the Shaksphere file and output returns the pattern in the lines and store the results in an output .txt file. This project is build using MAVEN and deployment is done using Docker container.   "
      - "JDBC App: The JDBC application developed primarily in Java deals with an RDBMS database and data manipulation is done using OOP concept such as Data Access Objects (DAO), Data Transfer Objects(DTO), and various other interfaces that joins both the java programming side and the relational database. At the core of this application, are the abilities to perform create, read, update, and delete operations from a RDBMS in a dockerized container of a PSQL instance. Apart from Java implementations in the project, MAVEN, Docker, PostgresSQL, and CLI are all interconnected to produce this application. The heart of the project lies in the concept of JDBC API which allows Java programs to access database management systems , and perform operations from a Java program interface. "

 Performed exploratory data analysis to identify, analyze, and interpret trends in weather data affecting meter readings on weekly, monthly, and yearly basis.
 Predicted utility meter readings from building data (location, number of floors, square feet, etc.) and weather data (air temperature, dew temperature, sea level pressure, etc.) using boosting algorithms (XGB, Cat Boost, Gradient) and deep learning models (RNN, CNN).
 Carried out a comparative analysis of different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models using RMSLE, MSE, MAPE, and RMSE as evaluation metrices."
